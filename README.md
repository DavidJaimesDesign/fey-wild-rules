# A Traveler's Guide to the Feywild

*Compiled by Elindra the Wayfarer, Chronicler of the Crossroads*

The Feywild is a realm of boundless beauty and capricious danger, where time dances to its own tune and every glade holds secrets. Unlike the orderly gates of the Outer Planes, the pathways to the Feywild are often fleeting, tied to nature's whims or the favor of its enigmatic rulers. Below are the most reliable (and least deadly) methods known to mortal scholars—though "reliable" is a generous term when dealing with the fey.

## 1. Faerie Rings
*"Step lightly, step true—lest the ring keep you."*

- **Description:** Natural circles of mushrooms, flowers, or stones, often found in forgotten groves or beneath ancient oaks.
- **Activation:** Enter the ring at twilight or dawn (the "in-between" hours). Some require:
  - A spoken rhyme
  - A gift (like honey or a shiny trinket)
  - The right state of mind (childlike wonder or deep sorrow)
- **Warning:** Not all rings lead home. Some are one-way; others may demand a price for passage back.

## 2. Mirror Portals
*"The truest reflection is the one that lies."*

- **Description:** Enchanted mirrors, still pools, or even dewdrops that show a warped version of reality—often revealing the Feywild's landscape instead of your own.
- **Activation Methods:
  - Touch the surface while speaking a fey's name
  - Spill moonlight-infused water upon it
  - Break it with a silver coin (risky, but effective)
- **Warning:** Some mirrors are sentient or guarded by possessive fey. Shattering one may strand you—or worse, draw its owner's ire.

## 3. Plane Shift Conduits
*"Magic bends where the fey will it."*

- **Description:** Deliberate magical gateways, often created by:
  - Archfey
  - Druids
  - Ancient standing stones humming with ley-line energy
- **Activation Requirements:
  - *Plane shift* spell
  - A fey-marked tuning fork
  - A rare token (e.g., a petal from the Eternal Bloom)
- **Warning:** The Feywild resists brute-force magic. Attempting to force a portal may attract dangerous attention.

---

## 4. Forgotten Doors
*"Knock once if you're willing; twice if you're lost."*

- **Description:** Doors found in:
  - Hollow trees
  - Cellar hatches
  - Paintings that shouldn't lead anywhere—yet do
- **Activation Methods:
  - Open with a key of carved rowan wood
  - Knock with a rhythm mimicking birdsong
  - Simply believe hard enough (the fey adore conviction)
- **Warning:** These doors often vanish behind travelers. Always bring a way back.

## Surviving the Feywild: Etiquette and Pitfalls

The Feywild operates on rules as unpredictable as its inhabitants. To avoid curses, eternal servitude, or being turned into a decorative shrub, heed these warnings:

### Absolute Prohibitions
- **Never say "Thank you"**  
  *It implies debt, which fey will collect—often painfully.*  
  Instead say: "Your generosity shines like the summer sun." (Flattery is currency.)

- **Never accept gifts freely given**  
  *Even a ribbon can bind you to a century of service.*  
  Always ask: "And what price must I pay for this kindness?"

- **Never give your full name**  
  *Names have power. Use titles or pseudonyms.*  
  Example: "I am called the Thorned Wanderer."

### Dangerous Behaviors
- **Eating Fey Food or Drink**  
  - One bite = nostalgia for the Feywild forever  
  - Three bites = inability to leave  
  - Exception: If a host *commands* you to eat (as part of guest-right), you must—but demand equal hospitality in return.

- **Making Promises**  
  Even casual vows become magically binding.  
  *Bad:* "I'll return someday." → You're now compelled.  
  *Better:* "Perhaps our paths may cross again." (Ambiguity is armor.)

- **Dancing**  
  - If music plays with no visible source, cover your ears.  
  - If you dance, you may never stop (or wake up decades later).

### Survival Tips
1. **Iron is your friend**  
   - Carry a cold iron nail (hidden).  
   - Fey recoil from it, but displaying it openly is an insult.

2. **Time is a trickster**  
   - Keep a *moonstone clock* (enchanted to track Material Plane time).  
   - Assume every "hour" spent here could be a day or year back home.

3. **Rules of Hospitality**  
   - If offered shelter by a noble fey, accept—but leave before dawn.  
   - Never refuse a direct challenge to a game, but *always* cheat first.

## How to Bargain with an Archfey (and Live to Tell the Tale)

*"All fey love games, but archfey play with mortal lives as pawns."*  
*—The Blackstaff’s Notes on Extraplanar Diplomacy*

### Core Principles
1. **They Always Want Something**  
   - Archfey never bargain without purpose. Identify their *true* desire:  
     - **Summer Court:** Novelty (a story no one has told), beauty (your reflection), or laughter (your darkest memory turned to farce).  
     - **Winter Court:** Sorrow (tears of a king), silence (the last note of a dying song), or secrets (the name of your first love).  

2. **The Rule of Three**  
   - Every offer must be made thrice:  
     - First offer: The archfey will mock it.  
     - Second offer: They’ll counter with something impossible.  
     - Third offer: *This* is when true negotiation begins.  

3. **Never Speak the Terms Aloud**  
   - Write them in air with moonbeam dust, or weave them into a riddle.  
   - Example: *"I’ll give you seven years of my service, but the oak must remember the acorn."* (Translation: The deal expires when you return to your homeland.)  

### Deadly Pitfalls
- **The Literal Trap**  
  - *Bad:* "I’d give my right arm for that sword!" → You’ll lose the arm *and* the sword.  
  - *Clever:* "I’d trade a year of my life as a mortal reckons time." (Specify solar years, not fey time.)  

- **The Infinite Loop**  
  - Archfey adore paradoxes. If they say: *"You may ask one question, but if it’s a lie, you’ll serve me forever,"* respond: *"Is the sky green?"* (Forces them to admit the terms are the lie.)  

- **The Unpaid Debt**  
  - If you owe an archfey, leave a *counter-gift* when departing their domain:  
    - A lock of hair wrapped in gold wire (symbolizes future meeting).  
    - A vial of your shadow (they’ll chase you to return it).  

### Successful Bargain Examples
1. **For Safe Passage**  
   - *Offer:* "I’ll carry your name to three mortal kings, sung in a tongue they’ve never heard."  
   - *Why it works:* Spreads the archfey’s influence without direct cost to you.  

2. **For a Favor**  
   - *Offer:* "Let me drink from your silver stream, and I’ll return bearing a seed from the World Tree."  
   - *Trick:* The "seed" is a pebble from your homeland—technically true, but harmless.  

3. **For Survival**  
   - When the archfey demands your voice: *"Take my laughter instead—but only when the crow sings."*  
   - Since crows don’t sing, you keep your laughter forever.
